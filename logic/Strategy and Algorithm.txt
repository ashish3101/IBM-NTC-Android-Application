/******************Strategy and Algorithm*********************/

Our algorithm is that we get the longitude and latitude of location of person
using GPS from mobile hardware and we get the latitude and longitude at every 
2 minutes. So, that RAM do not get burden.
To identify the person we use mobile IMEI Number.
As you say that you also want to know that how much time is spent by each 
person at specific latitude and longitude.So we also get that by getting difference
of its reaching and leaving time.

Library used:- Android API 8
